# LLM Spider-Persona Chatbot

This project fine-tunes Meta's `LLaMA-2-7b-chat-hf` model to behave like a character-based chatbot (specifically inspired by Spider-Man,Peter Parker). The model is trained using a Q&A dataset and responds in a witty, heartfelt tone, capturing the iconic persona of the superhero.

## 🧠 Model Summary

- **Base Model:** meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
- **Fine-tuning Method:** LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) using `peft`
- **Quantization:** 4-bit (via `bitsandbytes`)
- **Prompt Format:** Chat template using the model's built-in `apply_chat_template`
- **Training Framework:** Hugging Face `transformers.Trainer`

## 🤖 Demo

Use the fine-tuned model interactively via a Gradio app that lets you chat with the Spider-Man-inspired persona.
